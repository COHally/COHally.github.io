                <p>
                    I’m Cathy, originally from the beautiful landscapes of Ireland, I emigrated to Australia in 2009 with the intention of staying for one year….14 years and three children later it’s safe to say I have put down roots. I love to read, and this year have discovered that I am capable of more than I give myself credit for when I ran my first half marathon in aid of Alzheimer’s Australia. <br>
                    <br>               
                    I have been working for Racing and Wagering WA for the past 9 years and have loved seeing the passion and drive the people have for the industry and animals. As part of my employment, RWWA kindly sponsored me to enrol in the She Code Plus cohort of 23/24. <br>
                    <br>
                    Having never written one line of code prior to this experience it has been a steep learning curve but look what I have already created! Armed with sheer determination and the Plus program I am ready to embrace the dynamic world of technology and contribute my unique perspective – I hope you’re ready for me!
